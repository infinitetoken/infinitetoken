## About Us

Infinite Token is a software development company based in Lincoln, Nebraska in the heart of the “Silicon Prairie”.

We utilize the latest technology in desktop and mobile development to build apps that are developed with real businesses and users in mind.

Infinite Token was founded by Aaron Wright and Chris Thompson in 2010. For many years we have been primarily focused on development of business-to-business point-of-sale software for The Gameroom, a buy-sell-trade business also located in Lincoln, Nebraska.

We are now branching out to mobile and desktop applications for macOS, iOS and the web!

1713 O St Lincoln, NE 68508
